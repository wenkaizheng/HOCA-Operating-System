p1test.c tests the the queue and the asl modules using
the proc_link type.

p1test.c.queues tests the queue modules, it does not test 
the asl modules.

p1test2.c will insert a process into several queues, 
and it will remove it and test the results.

If your OS or function finds an error condition that
it cannot handle or recover from, it should panic
(stop the simulator).  Please look at the adderrbuf
function in p1test.c.  if an error condition is 
found, it copies an error message to an error buffer
and issues this command:  asm("   trap    #0");
The "trap 0" will halt the simulator.  You may want
to use the following panic routine:

char myerrbuf[128];

panic(s)
register char *s;
{
	register char *i=myerrbuf;

	while ((*i++ = *s++) != '\0')
		;

	asm("  trap    #0");  /* stop the simulator */
}
