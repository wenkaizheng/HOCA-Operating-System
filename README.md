# HOCA-Operating-System

The HOCA operating system implementation project has evolved over the years at Cornell
through contributions of Gregory Andrews, Thomas London, Charles Moore, Alan Shaw
and David Wright. We are grateful to them. Earlier versions of the project were designed
to be written in XPL and run on the CS983 computer simulator. Late Cornell versions of
the project were designed to be implented in C and execute on the PDP-11 simulator CHIP.
